      <p class="section-text">
          I am a Computer Science graduate at the University of Paris-Saclay. With a strong
          ambition to become a leading data architect and strategy engineer, I aim to make a
          difference in teams developing technologies that address tomorrowâ€™s major challenges.
          Beyond my technical interests, I have a deep passion for history, geography, and politics.
          <br>
          Having lived and studied in four countries and being fluent in four languages, I bring a
          global mindset and strong cross-cultural communication skills - an asset in diverse,
          collaborative environments.
